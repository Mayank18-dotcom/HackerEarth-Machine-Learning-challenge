APPROACH:
1)First did some data cleaning and observation of both train.csv and test.csv .
2)Using cross_val_score choose the best model. Decision Tree, RandomForest and xgboost resulted in above 85 % of accuracy and out of these 3, xgboost performed the best.
3)Training of model and then prediction of the values.
4)Saving answers into a new csv file.

FEATURE ENGINEERING:
1)For handling the issue_date and listing_date, I have converted them into datetime format, took the difference and seperated the number of days.
2)For handling the color_type I used OneHotEncoding.
3)As I have used xgboost, I did'nt handle missing values and let the xgboost handle it.

TOOLS / PACKAGES USED:
1)python 3.0 as main langulage.
2)pandas package for data manipulation and analysis.
3)numpy package for high-level mathematical functions to operate on arrays.
4)seaborn as data visualization.
4)cross_val_score for predicting scores on train dataset.
5)xgboost as a classifier.
